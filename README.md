# PathWise

## Overview

A web application which enables the user to visualize, track and also share their **personal and educational growth**. They will be able to track the skills and create a shareable summary which will highlight their development. The app **bridges the gap between traditional resumes and provides more in detail of lifelong learning**.

### Problem Space

This restriction makes it challenging for people to demonstrate their development in a comprehensive way and for businesses to evaluate applicants based on a proven learning trajectory.
